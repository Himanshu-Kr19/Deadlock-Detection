The primary objective of a deadlock detection algorithm is to ensure the efficient and reliable operation of concurrent systems.<BR>
It achieves this by identifying deadlocks, which occur when processes are unable to proceed due to resource contention.<BR>
This algorithms follows a standard approach to deadlock detection using the "Banker's algorithm" to detect the presence of a deadlock in the system.<BR>
In doing so, deadlock detection algorithms play a crucial role in maintaining the availability and integrity of concurrent systems.
