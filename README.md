The primary objective of a deadlock detection algorithm is to ensure the efficient and reliable operation of concurrent systems.
It achieves this by identifying deadlocks, which occur when processes are unable to proceed due to resource contention.
This algorithms follows a standard approach to deadlock detection using the "Banker's algorithm" to detect the presence of a deadlock in the system.
In doing so, deadlock detection algorithms play a crucial role in maintaining the availability and integrity of concurrent systems.
